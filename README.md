# Ecommerce Product Page
- This page is the product page. Users can view images of the product and when clicking on the image to see and examine the images larger, a modal opens where the image is larger. The pictures in this modal can be viewed by clicking on the thumbnails at the bottom or by scrolling the picture by pressing the back and forth buttons. The quantity of the product can be increased or decreased to buy one or more of the product. By pressing the add product button, the product is added to the cart and the current price is calculated according to the quantity of the product and can be seen in the cart.
